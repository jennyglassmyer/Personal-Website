               <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site!</h1>
               <p>
                  For the past five years I have worked in the non-profit space in Seattle, WA in various capacities helping refugees and forced migrants with their arrival and integration into the United States. At the same time I pursued my Master's degree in Refugee Protection and Forced Migration remotely through the University of London.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I am passionate about the right for people to seek and find asylum when fleeing their homes due to persecution, war and violence, climate change, or the desire for a better life. As a two time expat myself, I value the right for people to move internationally and the joys and difficulties this brings. As a scholar and practitioner within the refugee space I understand deeply the dire circumstances in which people can be forced to flee their homes.

               <p>
                  As I was completing my Master's Thesis, which researched and analyzed the real impact of academic research on policy-making on refugee and migrant issues in the United States, I became somewhat disolussioned with the state of the field. So many people (academics, practitioners, and even politicians) cared deeply about the plight of refugees, but were often at a loss to solve the problems they face in a practical way. One of the reasons for this that I identified was a lack of deep technical skills amongst people who knew the refugee and asylum world well.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Around the time I completed my Master's Degree (December 2020), my husband and I moved to Berlin, Germany and I left my job in the non-profit space. This led to a period of recalibration where I asked myself what impact I was having on refugee issues and came up lacking. I decided I wanted to help solve this technical gap in my field by learning Software Development.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Since January of 2021 I have been investing in my technical skills; taking online trainings, MOOCs, and eventually signing up for Le Wagon's Software Develpment bootcamp which I will start in June 2021.
               </p>
               <p>
                  I have grown to truly love coding and the science of computers and the more I learn the more excited I become about the potential for practical solutions in the refugee and forced migration world through tech!
